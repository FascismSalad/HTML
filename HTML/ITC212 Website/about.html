  <div class="aboutme">
    I was born in Canberra, ACT, and lived with my family in
    Queensland for a few years before moving to
    Wagga Wagga at 3 years old where I was raised for the
    majority of my life. I attended the entirety of my
    schooling including university study in wagga and
    have barely left the state since. <br /> <br />

    A notable exception being my first international trip in 2017.
    I left with a group to explore the UK, Netherlands and Germany.
    It was one of the best experiences of my life and has instilled
    a love of travel. Since then I have toured Tazmania in a
    campervan over several weeks and I plan to travel overseas
    to Asia in 2020. I one day hope to pursue a career in the
    technology industry that allows me to travel the globe.
